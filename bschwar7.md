Hi my name is Benjamin Schwartz I am a senior studying computer science graduating this May. I spend most of my time outside of my studies rock climbing. There are a bunch of beautiful places around Knoxville like a place called The Obed Wild Scenic River where I spend most of my time. I am excited to learning about various ways to collect and organize data. I also hope to learn how to present data in a meaningful way.
